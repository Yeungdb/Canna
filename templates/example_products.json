      "description": "This exceptional organically fed strain was carefully bred and cultivated by a master botanist. It displays a balance of berries and floral fruits, much as you would expect from its parentage. The effects are fairly euphoric up front, which tapers to a great body stone. Great for pain, and with a little patience, sleep.",
